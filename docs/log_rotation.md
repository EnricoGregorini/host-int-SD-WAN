# Enabling logrotate for log files generated by Host-INT

Host-INT can generate very big log files from the hostintd and
hostintcol processes.  Host-INT has no built-in capability to
perform automatic rotation, compression, or removal of log files, but
the logrotate utility can be configured to do so.

See the manual page for logrotate on your Linux systems for the
particular version of logrotate installed there.

Below is an example of configuring logrotate to set up log rotation
for the log file /var/log/hostintd_report.log, tested on Ubuntu 20.04.
That file is written by the hostintd process if you use the option "-o
/var/log/hostintd_report.log" when starting the hostintd service.

On Ubuntu 20.04, logrotate's configuration files are in the
directory /etc/logrotate.d.


# Sample log rotate configuration file.

As root, create a new file in the directory /etc/logrotate.d/ with
the following contents, e.g. it could be /etc/logrotate.d/hostintd
if your system does not already contain such a file.

```
/var/log/hostintd_report.log
{
        rotate 7
        daily
        missingok
        notifempty
        delaycompress
        compress
}
```

The log will go through 7 daily rotations before being removed.  The
"notifempty" option means that no rotation will occur if the latest
file from the most recent day is empty.
